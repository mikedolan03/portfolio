					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Ever since I got my hands on my first computer (my dad's black and orange screen suitcased-sized work laptop in the early '90s) I've been creating things with code. From making 'Choose you own adventure' games using Goto: statements in qBasic to building virtual reality worlds using Unity3D, I've always had a passion for programming. That's why I decided to join Thinkful's Full Stack Flex Web Developer program and finally make a switch into a career I always wanted to explore. At Thinkful, I built up my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to create responsive, mobile-first web applications as well as learned state-of-the-art web development techniques using Node and React.</p>
					<p>
					When I'm not coding web apps on my laptop, I might be on my other computer prototyping a video game or playing one, exploring Virginia's hiking trails with my wife and son, brewing gluten free beer or figuring out what the next exciting travel destination our family will be headed to.
